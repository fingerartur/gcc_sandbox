# GCC Sandbox

When it comes to type-checking Google Closure Compiler lags behind TypeScript
and considerably so. It is very _unclear_ what which parts of code will be
correctly type-checked and which will be silently ignored by the compiler.

Here is a simple sandbox to test out the capabilities of GCC.
